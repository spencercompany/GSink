			Google has become significantly intertwined into our every-day lives and as a result of that, many individuals and businesses have come to depend on Gmail and Google Contacts.
			</p>
			<p>
			The reality is that many people have their very own Gmail accounts and are pretty married to them already. People who collaborate regularly need a simple and easy way to share and synchronize contacts with each other and if you are using Gmail or Google Apps, there is no simple way to do this…until GSink.
			</p>
			<p>
			GSink is a cleverly simple, easy-to-use tool that is free for individuals or businesses sharing up to 500 contacts.
			</p>
			<p>
			GSink works like this:
			</p>
			<p>
			A person, let’s call him “Joe” wants to share his Google Contacts with Mary, John and Peter (or maybe a dozen…or a hundred other people). All Joe needs to do is sign up for a GSink account and register his Gmail or Google Apps email and password into GSink. Joe will need to set himself up as the Authoritative user and he will need to enter the email and password for each Non-Authoritative user. There is no limit to how many Non-Authoritative users you can register, and every time you sync your contacts, each of the other users will receive an exact copy of every contact in the Authoritative user’s Google Contacts list.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now for the most part, people are pretty leery of giving the power of a password to someone else, but GSink assumes that everyone is working in harmony and that they want to share the information. This application does just one thing…syncs a single person’s Google Contacts with one or many (unlimited) other people.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sign up today and try GSink for your contact sharing needs!
