    About GSink
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    GSink is open source software maintained and developed by a community of users and
    dedicated developers. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
    License (or "GPL"), which means anyone is free to download it and share it with
    others. This open development plan ensures that the community is constantly making
    improvements to GSink and that encourages collaboration and high-quality software.

    GSink will let you share your Google Contacts with one or an unlimited number of
    other Gmail or Google Apps users anywhere in the world. The speed of the sync depends
    upon how many contacts you have and how many other people you will be syncing with
    plus the quality of the equipment being used on the server. The software will attempt
    to predict the time at which the sync will complete for you. The sync is a one-way
    sync designed to faithfully copy your contacts to one or an unlimited number of other
    Gmail or Google Apps users. The system is fully automated, nobody sees the
    information ( when the SSL protection is set up ) nor is any form of human
    interaction or support needed for contact sharing - it just works. Only the contacts
    with at least one email address will be synced because GSink requires the email
    address field to match up contacts. In other words (and to avoid many questions about
    this), contacts without email addresses will not be synced.
    
    GSink is presently used by government agencies, law offices, small to large
    companies and cool people just like you.

    Installation Instructions
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Get the source files by using methods provided by GIT or download the source code as
    a compressed package. Unzip / download / copy to a folder on the server that will be
    used for the site.
    
    2. Set up the web server for the site and (optionally, but highly recommended)
    install an SSL certificate
    
    3. Make a new database and import the contents of the included database.sql file.
    
    4. Edit config.inc
    
    	4.1. Insert host of the database as the value of DB_HOST, name of the database as
    the value of DB_NAME, user that has access to the database as the value of DB_USER
    and password for the user as the value of DB_PASS.
    
    	4.2. If you would like to use Google Ads on your site
    then you can set the value of GOOGLE_AD_CLIENT to be the Google Ad client ID. 
		
		4.3. Set HAS_SSL either to true or false depending on whether you want to have a 
	protected connection to the server. IMPORTANT! Please be sure to either use GSink over 
	a local protected network or use an SSL certificate.
